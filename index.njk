    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>This is a TSP investment model based on Mebane Faber's paper, <i><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=962461">A Quantitative Approach to Tactical Asset Allocation</a></i>. Faber describes an investment system that is based on comparing the current price of a fund to the 10-month simple moving average (SMA) of that fund, and making a buy/sell decision based on that comparison.</p>
    <p>Applied to the TSP, this means we watch the C, S, and I funds. If the price of any of these funds drops below its 10-month SMA, we move money from that fund to the G fund. Conversely, if a fund's price rises above its 10-month SMA, we move money from the G fund to that stock fund. You decide how much of your investment you want to allocate to each fund. The F fund and the L funds are not a part of this model.</p>
    <p>Faber's model only looks at the prices once a month after the final trading day of the month. This is a perfect fit for the TSP since we are only allowed two trades per month plus one move to the G Fund per month.</p>
    <p>I originally learned of this model from a <a href="https://federalnewsradio.com/federal-report/2016/07/want-more-control-over-your-investments/">Federal News Radio article</a>, which describes in detail how Faber's model can be applied to the TSP.</p>
    <p>If you are considering following this model for your investments, there are a few things you should keep in mind:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Everyone's investment needs are different. This model may or may not fit your needs.</li>
      <li>I am just a human pounding away at a keyboard. Humans make mistakes. You should verify the numbers for yourself rather than relying on my calculations.</li>
    </ul>
